## RAG Model Implementation
### Minimal Requirements
1. Define the project scope and objectives.
2. Identify the project stakeholders.
3. Create a work breakdown structure (WBS).
4. Develop a project schedule.
5. Identify project risks and develop a risk management plan.
6. Develop a project budget.
7. Develop a project quality plan.
8. Obtain formal approval to proceed.
9. Implement the project plan.
10. Monitor and control project work.
11. Perform integrated change control.
12. Close the project or phase.

### Tools to be used for RAG
1. Project Management Software (e.g., Asana, Trello, MS Project)
2. Collaboration Tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams)
3. Version Control Systems (e.g., Git, SVN)
4. Agile Project Management Methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban)
5. Risk Management Tools (e.g., Risk Matrix, SWOT Analysis)
6. Budgeting and Cost Estimation Tools (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets)
7. Quality Management Tools (e.g., ISO 9001, Six Sigma)
8. Communication and Stakeholder Management Tools (e.g., Email, Project Management Software)
9. Python Framework: Flask
10. Additional Tools: Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF, Flask-RESTful

### Setting up Python, Miniconda, and Flask API
1. **Install Python**:
	* Go to the official Python download page and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.
	* Follow the installation instructions to install Python.
2. **Install Miniconda**:
	* Go to the official Miniconda download page and download the latest version of Miniconda for your operating system.
	* Follow the installation instructions to install Miniconda.
	* Once installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type `conda --version` to verify the installation.
3. **Create a new environment for Flask**:
	* Open a terminal or command prompt and type `conda create --name flaskenv` to create a new environment named `flaskenv`.
	* Activate the environment by typing `conda activate flaskenv`.
4. **Install Flask**:
	* Once the environment is activated, type `pip install Flask` to install Flask.
	* Verify the installation by typing `python -c "from flask import Flask; app = Flask(__name__); print(app)"`.
5. **Create a new Flask project**:
	* Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
	* Create a new file named `app.py` and add the following code:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
	* Run the application by typing `python app.py`.
	* Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to see the application in action.
6. **Install additional Flask extensions**:
	* Install Flask-SQLAlchemy by typing `pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy`.
	* Install Flask-WTF by typing `pip install Flask-WTF`.
	* Install Flask-RESTful by typing `pip install Flask-RESTful`.
7. **Verify the installation of additional extensions**:
	* Verify the installation of Flask-SQLAlchemy by typing `python -c "from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy; db = SQLAlchemy(); print(db)"`.
	* Verify the installation of Flask-WTF by typing `python -c "from flask_wtf import FlaskForm; class MyForm(FlaskForm): pass; print(MyForm)"`.
	* Verify the installation of Flask-RESTful by typing `python -c "from flask_restful import Api; api = Api(); print(api)"`.
8. **Start building your Flask API**:
	* Start building your Flask API by creating routes, models, and forms as needed.
	* Use Flask-SQLAlchemy for database operations, Flask-WTF for form handling, and Flask-RESTful for API endpoints.

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generator. It is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to produce more accurate and informative responses.

In a RAG model, the retrieval component is responsible for searching a large database or knowledge base to find relevant information related to the input prompt or query. The generator component then takes this retrieved information and uses it to generate a response.

The key advantage of RAG models is that they can leverage the vast amount of knowledge stored in large databases or knowledge bases, while also being able to generate novel and context-specific responses.
